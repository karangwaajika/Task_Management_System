This lab evolves around developing a web application using Java frameworks.
The aim is to understand Java Web Development using Servlets/JSP, getting familiar with Restful API.

## Video

* Final Project: https://screenrec.com/share/qYIBvsu5FR

## Usage

* ERD design: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yx91iDzRJZj91rGV1AZgFM__RQeRkDOn/view?usp=sharing
* JSP File: Interacting with the app
    - Inside webapp there is jsp which holds all the jsp pages
    - static director is where CSS and Images is located
    - NB: for now the front-end is not implemented only the backend.
* Backend codes: Logic behind (MVC Architecture)
    - controller directory handle http request and response
    - dao is where sql query is implemented
    - model holds all project classes
    - service has the business logic
    - util connect the project with the database

## Expected Learning Outcomes

- Understand Java Web Development using Servlets/JSP or Spring/Thymeleaf.
- Build a functional CRUD web application with proper HTTP handling.
- Implement RESTful APIs and handle client-server interactions.
- Apply MVC architecture for better project structure.
- Work with dynamic content rendering in JSP or Thymeleaf.
